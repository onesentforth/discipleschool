</div>

Hi, I'm Jason West and I have been studying and teaching the Bible for a couple of decades.

I have an insatiable curiosity. In fact, it's almost an obsessive compulsion to mentally explore all sorts of seemingly unrelated subjects and fit all of the knowledge I discover into one unified system, or one big picture of reality.

I sometimes get lost in my own little world of theoretical possibilities, seeing everything in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. Additionally, I often feel a sort of personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and help others move towards a higher understanding of whatever I have been researching. I suppose that's what drives me to become a better teacher.

So my life is pretty much summed up by those two activities: Explore and Explain.

And this website is where I will try to EXPLAIN the things I EXPLORE.

As I read an article recently, I discovered this amazing quote from <b>Thomas J. Watson</b>, the famous chairman and CEO of International Business Machines (IBM):

<blockquote >
  <li>"Follow the path of the unsafe, <b>independent thinker</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Expose your ideas</b> to the dangers of controversy.</li>
  <li><b>Speak your mind</b> and fear less the label of 'crack-pot' than the stigma of conformity.</li>
  <li>And on issues that seem important to you, <b>stand up and be counted</b> at any cost."</li>
</blockquote>

By the time I stumbled across his quote, I was already on the path towards creating this blog and finally publishing my thoughts and ideas about the Bible and other church-related issues. But reading it made me more determined than ever to expose my ideas and speak my mind - in other words, to make this website a reality.

I'm glad you've decided to stop by. I hope you are challenged by what you encounter here.
