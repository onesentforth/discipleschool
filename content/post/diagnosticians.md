If we're going to be effective at that kind of mind-changing - this sort of TRUE CONVERSION - then we will have to become what Walker Percy would call DIAGNOSTICIANS. Percy was trained to be a medical doctor at Columbia University after WWII, but he contracted TB from a cadaver. His treatment involved spending a couple of years in upstate New York in sanitariums. In this time of isolation, he spent a considerable amount of time reading - everything from Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard to Sartre and Susanne Langer. During this time, he was converted to Christ and made the decision to become a writer. This wasn't a huge jump from physician to writer, in his mind, because both are involved in making a diagnosis. He said, "A diagnostician is a person who stands towards another person in the relation of one who knows that something has gone wrong with the other."

"He observed that both the novelist and the pathologist begin with a hunch that there is something wrong, and each seeks to find and to name the malady. The pathologist pokes around (with a fairly sophisticated set of tools) until he can identify and name what caused the patient to get sick or die. The novelist has essentially the same calling. He pokes around in the remains of human behavior and culture to discern where they are diseased. They begin with a hunch, and they poke around until they identify and name what is wrong. The notion that there is a calling to be a diagnostician of the human condition is one that ought to strike gospel-oriented people as right on target. It is fruitful to think about our mission as apologists and evangelists as involving a calling to be a diagnostician. We are the diagnosticians of our age, of the institutions of the world, of the global condition, and of the individual souls touched by all of these contours of the contemporary landscape. It is our calling to poke around and identify what it is that is wrong. It is up to us to find and name the maladies that are rampant throughout culture. How are these cultures, institutions, and individuals resistant to thick gospel reality?" (Craig, William Lane; Copan, Paul [2012-03-01]. Come Let Us Reason: New Essays in Christian Apologetics, Kindle Locations 176-193). The disciple-maker has the same task and faces the same challenges.

Why? Because as J. Gresham Machen said, "It would be a great mistake to suppose that all men are equally well-prepared to receive the gospel." There are obstacles in his mind that may prevent him from even CONSIDERING the gospel. God usually exerts regenerative power "in connection with certain prior conditions of the human mind, and it should be ours to create, so far as we can, with the help of God, those favorable conditions for the reception of the gospel." He goes on to say that "False ideas are the greatest obstacles to the reception of the gospel. We may preach with all the fervor of a reformer and yet succeed only in winning a straggler here and there, if we permit the whole collective thought of the nation or of the world to be controlled by ideas which, by the resistless force of logic, prevent Christianity from being regarded as anything more than a harmless delusion." (Machen, J. Gresham (2012-11-21). Christianity and Culture [Kindle Location 90]).
Nobody will listen to your gospel presentation if the Bible and its claims are outside of their plausibility structure - or the set of ideas the person either is or is not willing to entertain as possibly true. For example, no one would come to a lecture defending a flat earth because this idea is not part of our plausibility structure. We cannot even entertain the idea. Moreover, a person's plausibility structure is a function of the beliefs he or she already has. Our goal is to plant a seed in the minds of our culture and present people with an idea that will work on their plausibility structure in order to create a space in which Christianity can be entertained seriously (Foreman).
