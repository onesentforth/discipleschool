I remember when I first purchased John Eldredge's book *[Waking the Dead](https://amzn.to/2S89o7I).* I was completely amazed by it, and unable to put it down.

I've read it multiple times, and my copy is lovingly marked by dog-eared pages, highlighted passages, post-it notes and copious marginalia.

There are parts of the book that deeply impacted my life. I remember reading it many times with tears in my eyes. It was as if someone had seen into my soul and was putting words to thoughts and questions I had been too afraid to own.

I have used several passages from the book as illustrations when preaching and teaching. One of them I used most is about John Spillane - the para-rescue jumper from the Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing
On October 30, 1991, The 106th was called out on a mission that was later made into a book and a movie entitled, *The Perfect Storm*.

>When Spillane {The Perfect Storm) treats injured seamen offshore, one of the first things he evaluates is their degree of consciousness. The highest level, known as "alert and oriented times four," describes almost everyone in an everyday situation. They know who they are, where they are, what time it is, and what's just happened. If someone suffers a blow to the head, the first thing they lose is recent events "alert and oriented times three" and the last thing they lose is their identity. A person who has lost all levels of consciousness, right down to their identity, is said to be "alert and oriented times zero." When John Spillane wakes up in the water, he is alert and oriented times zero. His understanding of the world is reduced to the fact that he exists, nothing more. Almost simultaneously, he understands that he is in excruciating pain. For a long time, that is all he knows.

>John Spillane is a para-rescue jumper sent into the North Atlantic, into the worst storm of the twentieth century, the perfect storm, as the book and film called it, to rescue a fisherman lost at sea. **When his helicopter goes down, he is forced to jump into pitch blackness from an unknown height, and when he hits the water, he's going so fast it's like hitting the pavement from eighty feet above. He is dazed and confused just as we are when it comes to the story of our lives. It's the perfect analogy. We have no idea who we really are, why we're here, what's happened to us, or why. Honestly, most days we are alert and oriented times zero.**

I think he's right. Most of us have a very limited awareness. We certainly don't act as though we were in a war. But that's what the Bible is trying to tell us.

We have an enemy.
