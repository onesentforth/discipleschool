Christianity is failing.

You may disagree. But this isn't a matter of opinion. I can prove it.

Failure can be demonstrated by answering two questions:

1. What's this thing for?
2. How's it supposed to do that?

First, what is it that we're supposed to be doing? What should be the end result of Christianity? Is there something we should be producing?

We don't have to guess about that. Jesus makes his expectations very clear:

- Disciples (of Jesus)
- Unity
- Rapid Expansion (mustard and leaven)
- Far reach (all people groups)


Secondly, we have to ask how we're supposed to be accomplishing that task. The Bible gives us some clear instructions about what we need to do in order to accomplish the goal.

After all, our lack of success could not be considered a failure if we were following the instructions that Jesus told us would lead to . We could avoid all blame in the matter and

No system is failing. It is doing exactly what it is designed to do. You don't need to "fix" the system. In fact, you can't fix it because it's not broken. It's functioning exactly as it was designed. What you need is a different system. One that is designed to produce the results you're hoping for.

I'm suggesting that we're getting exactly what we're designed to get. The church is producing just what it is designed to produce.

"No it isn't. After all, our church (random achievement)."
No matter what you're measuring at your church, the only way to determine failure is to compare expectations against results. We need to compare Jesus' expectations against our results.

"But, we can't control outcomes. All we can do is obey the Bible."
That would imply that our practices are biblical. Let's examine them...
